topic: algebraic specifications in Maude

deadline: 23.11.2022

Intensive Care Unit
===================
task 1: create algebraic specification of a control system at intensive care unit (ICU)
	- what you should capture in your model (specification, prototype):
		many dynamic characteristics (properties) of a human body (physiology) are continuously monitored (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, breathing frequency, neural/brain signals, etc)
		in case of a problem observed by some of the sensors and monitors, the control system quickly decides that some machine will respond by some action (for example, the dropper will immediately start to deliver more fluid of some kind)
	- general principle: the control system of ICU receives inputs from various sensors, produces some outputs (reports), and performs certain actions

task 2: document your solution
	- explain key decisions and high-level design

task 3: prepare some test cases (scenarios, inputs)
	- common scenarios that may occur in a real hospital
